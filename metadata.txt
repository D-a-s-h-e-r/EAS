description=This plug-in estimates the equal area slope of polylines using an underlying topography raster.
version=0.1

about=Estimating the equal area slope of a catchment or flow path is a necessary step in many hydrological calculations. While not a particularly difficult calculation, it can be time-consuming and hard to document, especially when doing rework. This plug-in aims to streamline the process by providing a method for estimating the equal area slopes of all features in the input vector layer. The algorithm creates a virtual layer with the calculated results in its attribute table.

# Uncomment the following line and add your changelog:
changelog=Equal area slope is now estimated by the average of a forward and backward sample pass along the line, which means drawing direction is not important. Removed bug where one extra point was sometimes being sampled beyond the end of a line
