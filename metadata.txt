description=This plug-in calculates the equal area slope of polylines from an underlying topography raster.
version=0.1
author=Andrew Campbell
email=andrew.j.campbell@aecom.com



about=Calculating the equal area slope of a catchment or flow path is a necessary step in many hydrological calculations. While it is not a particularly difficult calculation, it can be fiddly and time-consuming, especially when doing rework. This plug-in aims to streamline the process.
